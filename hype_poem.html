	<div style="display:none" aria-hidden=true>

		<div>I figured it would be good for us. Sometimes it’s easier to run than to talk.
</div>
		<div>Oh buddy, your hands. We continue running, my fist against my mouth. Though I’m bundled up nicely, it seems I’ve forgotten how susceptible my hands are to the cold.
</div>
		<div>I love you, bud.
</div>
		<div>I haven’t run since the last time he asked. And we haven’t spoken much since last time either.
</div>
		<div>Where are your gloves? They’re sitting in my room, leaving my hands unprotected.
</div>
		<div>Cloudy breath bellows out of my nose like the sigh of a steam engine.
</div>
		<div>The cold makes my head hurt, which I only realize as we come to a stop at the turn.
</div>
		<div> I was ready to study in my room, but he pulled me away, asking to go for a run.
</div>
		<div>He stays a few steps out of reach until we pause at the mile marker.
</div>
		<div>The run was impromptu, a way to step away from everything and let out steam.
</div>
		<div>I see him exerting himself, and think if he’s sweating out any of the worry.
</div>
		<div>He pulls ahead, outpacing me by just over a hair’s width.
</div>
		<div>The air is brisk and biting. It chaps my knuckles, cracking my skin and digging miniature wounds onto which I place my lips to stop the bleeding.
</div>
		<div>Then we finally reach the last bridge. We grasp our knees and breathe heavily.
</div>
		<div>We pass a large pack of highschoolers running the opposite direction.
</div>
		<div>click anywhere</div>
		<div>Then we make one last sprint, pushing ahead with all we have left, until we reach the turn, relieved.
</div>
		<div>I figured it would be good for me too. At the very least we’re outside, and together.
</div>
